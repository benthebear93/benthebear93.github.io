# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am a PhD student in robotics, working on contact-rich manipulation and control.
  My research focuses on force-distributed contact models, trajectory optimization,
  and sim-to-real transfer for robotic manipulation.

  I am currently pursuing my PhD at [University of Southern Denmark(SDU)](https://www.sdu.dk/en).
  My research interests are primarily in robotics, control, and learning-based methods.
